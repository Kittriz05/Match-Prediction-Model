# Match-Prediction-Model
This model predicts the outcome of the match using the relevant features.
The steps are as follows:
1. Data Loading and Cleaning
•	Goal: Prepare the data for analysis and model training.
•	Actions:
1.	Load the dataset into a Data Frame.
2.	Drop unnecessary columns like Date, xG, Home, Away, and match results.
3.	Split the dataset into training (for seasons up to 2022) and testing (for the 2023 season).
2. Feature Engineering
•	Goal: Create new, meaningful features that help predict match outcomes.
•	Actions:
1.	Identify important columns related to the match, such as rolling averages of goals, xG (expected goals), etc.
2.	Remove irrelevant columns and create additional features if necessary.
3. Train-Test Split
•	Goal: Split the dataset into independent features (X_train and X_test) and the target variable (y_train and y_test).
•	Actions:
1.	Define the features for training.
2.	Split the data into training and testing sets based on the seasons.
4. Model Training
•	Goal: Train the prediction model using Random Forest.
•	Actions:
1.	Choose a machine learning model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier).
2.	Fit the model using training data.
5. Model Evaluation
•	Goal: Evaluate the model performance by predicting match outcomes and calculating accuracy.
•	Actions:
1.	Use the model to predict outcomes on the test set.
2.	Calculate accuracy using accuracy_score.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
•	Goal: Fine-tune model parameters to improve its performance using Grid Search.
•	Actions:
1.	Define a range of hyperparameters (e.g., number of estimators, maximum depth).
2.	Use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
7. Prediction of New Data
•	Goal: Use the trained model to predict the outcome of a future match.
•	Actions:
1.	Create a new data instance representing the new match.
2.	Use the model to predict the outcome based on this new match data.
